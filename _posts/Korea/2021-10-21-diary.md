I can say that this year, 2021 is the hardest year I'm doing my best everyday in my life. 
I slept only 4 hours everyday from march, 2021.
But, I can't sure I can get what I want.
As time goes by, I'm losing confidence and self-esteem, especialy when I see mails which is writting I failed to get pass.
It's time to get used to it, but it always breaks my heart.
And I come up with one question 'how many more days I have to do my best'.
But, you know, when I feel this kind of emotion, I feel grow up. Even if I didn't get good result yet, honestly, **these sad days make me strong and decide that I should be perfect**.

If the world don't know my value and I can't become shine in this world, let's create new world I can be shine.

**Believe yourself.
Don't regret on your passionate past.**
Today will be yesterday, tomorrow will be today.
So, just keep doing hard as always and make everyday and evey moment more precious.

It will make a miracle for you, for your world, for your universe.

### **Desparate triumphs over luck**
I'm unlucky like other lucky people, but I'm more desparate than anyone else.
**Desparate will win.**
