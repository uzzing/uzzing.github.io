# **What is binary search algorithm?**
```text
1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose the middle element, as doing so causes the set of candidates to be halved each time.
(To reduce the set of candidates maximally.)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use the information that all the elements are sorted

3Ô∏è‚É£ The time complexity is O(log n)
```
## üìå Example
### - Java
- Iterative binary seach
: **More efficient** than recursive binary search

```java
// space complexity : O(1)
// time complexity : O(log n)

int BSearch(int arr[], int target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length - 1;
    int mid;

    while (low <= high) {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == target)
            return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] > target)
            high = mid - 1;
        else
            low = mid + 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
- Recursive binary search
```java
// space complexity : O(log N)
// time complexity : O(log n)

int BSearchRecursive(int arr[], int target, int low, int high) {
    
    if (low > high) return -1;

    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    
    if (arr[mid] == target)
        return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] > target)
        return BSearchRecursive(arr, target, low, mid - 1);
    else
        return BSearchRecursive(arr, target, mid + 1, high);
}
```


The major difference between the **iterative** and **recursive version of Binary Search** is that the recursive version has a space complexity of **O(log N)** while the iterative version has a space complexity of **O(1)**. 
Hence, even though recursive version may be easy to implement, **the iterative version is efficient**.
Time complexity is same.


### - Python
```python
def binarySearch(A, x): 
    n = len(A)
    beg=0
    end=n-1
    result = -1
    while (beg <= end):
        mid = (beg + end) / 2 
        if (A[mid] <= x):
            beg = mid + 1
            result = mid 
        else:
            end = mid - 1 
    return result
```
