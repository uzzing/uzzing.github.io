I've mentioned this before, but I'm gonna explain it in more detail.

# **What is dynamic programming?**

```text
An algorithmic paradigm that
1Ô∏è‚É£ solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems
and
2Ô∏è‚É£ stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again
```

# **Feature of dynamic programming**

## üìå Memoization

1. make dynamic table and **store the results** of expensive function calls for do later things.

2. When you do the next task, **you calculate it by looking at the values stored in the table,** it's not calculating it from the beginning. 


## üìå Condition (Property)

For dynamic programming, these two conditions is needed.

1. Optimal substructure
    : - An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.

2. Overlapping problems
    : - A problem have overlapping **subproblems which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm** for the problem **solves the same subproblem** over and over rather than always generating new subproblems.


## üìå Example
- Assembly Line Problem
- Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem
- 0/1 Knapsack Problem

## **‚≠êÔ∏è Plus**
### **'Dynamic programming' üÜö 'Divide and conquer algorithm'**

1. Common feature
```
solve an optimization problem 
by breaking it down into simpler subproblem
```

2. Difference

 **the divide and conquer**
    : **combines the solutions of the sub-problems** to obtain the solution of the main problem 

**dynamic programming**
    : **uses the result of the sub-problems** to find the optimum solution of the main problem
