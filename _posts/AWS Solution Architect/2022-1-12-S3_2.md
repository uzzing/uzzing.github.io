### S3 

- S3 is in a global region.
- most services are going to be region specific.
And you'd have to switch between them to see the resources of them
- but not for s3
- you see all your buckets from every single region in one view, which is very convenient.

--- 

### Create S3
- a bucket name 
    - has to be unique.
    - has to be DNS compliant.
    - you're not allowed certain characters.

### Delete S3

### Upload files and make public

- If we're going to access files `by url` after uploading files, we're going to be see that it's disabled.

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 2 13 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149068987-0a4b29a6-1a18-4a0b-a690-4025879616bf.png">

So, <br>
`make it public`
- 1. Permissions (in the top)
    - allow public access.
- 2. Edit on 'Block public access'

- 3. Untick 'block all public access' and save.

- 4. Go to each file and click the button 'make public'

---

### Versioning

- for newer files

- 1. Properties (in the top)
- 2. Versioning and tick 'Enabled'
    - default : suspend versioning
- 3. Overview (in the top)
    - we can see versions tab
        - we can go hide and show 
        - we can add information for the version ID

    <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 2 29 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149069404-ed72c23d-db77-456a-b928-f3380f6c50c5.png">

    - if we hit show, we can see versions.
    
    <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 2 31 15 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149069651-5aa186d8-cd37-4607-b0c4-1df410eaca56.png">

- 4. Upload new files here, which have the exact same name 
    - if we hit show again, we can see that some of our files where we've done some uploading there have additional versions.
    - the initial files has `null` version ID
    - but if we upload files after turning versioning on, those files have the version ID
        - the only reason the version ID is null is because they existed prior before turning versioning on.

    <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 2 35 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149069915-14d1f2d7-538e-4ead-b2d5-3ebdb4af1778.png">

    - if we see files, we can see the latest version of file.
        - if you wanna see the previous version, you drop down here.
        <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 2 38 17 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149070208-b99f5878-ee16-4852-90b1-ce717578e94e.png">

- 5. Make the latest version `public`
    - the latest version is not gonna inherit the original properties like for the public access
    (but the previous version is still public)

- if you delete a file which is the latest version
    - it still shows up in the console. but the file is no longer there.

#### Features of Versioning 
- it helps you protect from the deletion of files. 
- it allows you to keep versions of stuff and those properties.
    - which means it does not carry over to the next one.

---

### SSE (Server-side Encryption)
- 1. Properties
- 2. Default encryption
    - byt default, it is setting None.

    <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 3 00 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149072399-53919b86-2c07-4498-896e-185076c2d0e9.png">

    - the warning : This property does not affect existing objects in your bucket.

- 3. Turn AES-256 on
    - but server-side encryption is still `none`.

    <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 3 03 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149073000-0a22bc1c-0928-4aa1-8872-1c9b263a0f01.png">

- 4. Go to Properties of each file

    - you can set individual encryption profiles.
        - you can also do it per bucket.

    <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 3 07 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149073209-32c4f055-1449-414e-be35-ea65bae113e2.png">

- 5. now if we were to go access this URL
    - but data is public.
    - can't we access it? `NO`
    - `the encryption doesn't mean that the files aren't accessible.`
        - It just because we have made this file public, it just means that `when they're at rest on the servers on AWS, there are going to be encrypted.`

### CLI for S3 (Command Line Interface)

- how to access private files using presigned URL.

- ls
```
# List all buckets
aws s3 ls

# List all folders and objects in bucket
aws s3 ls exampro-000
# result : PRE enterprise-d/
# = aws s3 ls s3://exampro-000

# List all folders and objects in folder
aws s3 ls exampro-000/enterprise-d/
# = aws s3 ls s3://exampro-000/enterprise-d
```
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 3 24 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149075162-c9eaa271-5477-4e27-a819-9709632df7b1.png">


- cp
```
# Download object to my desktop
aws s3 cp s3://exampro-000/enterprise-d/barclay.jpg ~/Desktop/barclay.jpg
# cp (original file's path) (new file's path)


# Upload object to my s3 bucket 
aws s3 cp ~/Desktop/enterprise-d/q.jpg s3://exampro-000/enterprise-d/q.jpg

# by default, it's private
```

- presign
    - generate a URL `to provide temporary access to private files.`
    - This is definitely a use case that you'd have if let's say you had paid content behind, like a web application that you'd have to sign up to gain access.

```
# Create presigned url that expires in 300 seconds

aws s3 presign s3://exampro-000/enterprise-d/q.jpg --expires-in 300
```

### Lifecycle policies
- case1. change the storage class for objects
    - we're gonna do it at the object level.

`steps`
- 1. Properties
- 2. Storage class
- 3. Choose the class that we want to standardize and save
    - we can save cost


- case2. if you want to automate that process.
    - because if we were handling a lot of log files
    : let's say after 30 days we don't really need them anymore, but we need to hold them on fro the next seven years.
    - that's where lifecycle policies are going to come in play
    - we're gonna do that at the `bucket level`

`steps`
- 1. Go to bucket
- 2. Management
- 3. Add a new lifecycle rules
    - Name and scope
    : we could limit the scope of what files we want
    - Transition
    : we have to decide whether it's the current version or the previous version
    - Expiration
    : it's not necessary, but if we want to actually delete the file after the current days

### CRR (Cross-Region Replication)
- for greater durability
- it allow us to copy one file from a bucket to another bucket.
- this could be another region and in another AWS account

- 1. Go to S3
- 2. Create new bucket
    - which has another region
- 3. Go to new bucket (destination)
    - Make sure that we have versioning turned on in both buckets (both the source bucket and destination bucket)
- 4. Turn versioning on
- 5. Go to origin bucket (source) - Management - Replication
- 6. Add rules
    - Set source
    - Set destination
        - Change storage class (not necessary)
            - it's a good idea if you want to `save money`. 
            - It's like your `backup bucket`.
            - If you don't actually use files.
        - Object ownership (not necessary)
            - you can also send this to someone else's bucket in another AWS account
            - your use case is this bucket has files and you want to provide it to multiple clients.
    - Configure rule options

### Bucket policies
- we can custom rules about the type of access we want to allow to our buckets.

- 1. Go to bucket.
- 2. Permissions
- 3. Bucket Policy
    - it's providing a policy in the format of json file
    - there's a policy generator on below
- 4. Use AWS Policy Generator
- 5. Copy and paste json

### Words

- That's the question I have in the back of my mind
- apparently, we totally can
- a slightly different N
- syntax
- stand for (=represent)
    - what does that stand for?
- it's not a big deal : 별거 아니다
- etc : Et cetera
- the roll isn't created in time
- asterisk : *
- retrieval
- tradeoff
- availability : usefulness, 可用性
    - operantinal availability : 使用可用性
- Usability : 易用性
- Archive
