### S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- it provides you with `unlimited storage`
- The S3 console provides an interface for you to upload and access your data.
- S3 Object : contain data like files.
    - You can store data from 0 bytes to 5 Terabytes in size.
- S3 Bucket : hold objects like folders.
    - Bucket names must be unique.

### Object-based storage service
``
data storage architecture that manages data as objects (as opposed to other storage architecture)
``
    - `file systems` which manages data as files and fire hierarchy
    - `block storage` which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks

### Storage Classes
(less cheaper)
- Standard(default)
- Intelligent Tiering
- Standard Infrequently Accessed (IA)
- One Zone IA
- Glacier 
    - for cold data
        - the points : price(The lowest price), safety(99.9% durability) -> so it's the best for cold data
- Glacier Deep Archive
(the cheapest)


``
Amazon S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for data archiving and long-term backup. With S3 Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or even decades.

``
AWS is guarantee of 99.99% of availability, 11's durability.

### Security
- Log files are generated and saved in a different bucket. (not the same bucket)
(Logging per request can be turned on a bucket.)

- ACL(Access Control Lists
    - the way to control access simply.


- Bucket Policies
    - it is generally used more.
    - you have to write a JSON document policy
    - a lot more rich, complex rules.
    - if you are ever setting up static S3, you definitely have to use a bucket policy
    - there's no fool proof.


### Encryption 
- SSE (Server Side Encryption)
    - SSE-AES : AES-256 (uses 256 bytes, very long encryption)
    - SSE-KMS
         - Key Management Service
         - it uses envelope encryption
         - so the key is then encrypted with another key
         - It's either managed by AWS or managed by you the key itself.
    - SSE-C
        - C : Customer provided keys
        - it's no option in default encryption
        - it's just encrypting the files locally and then uploading them to S3.
    

### Data Consistency

- Consistency
: Consistency is going to be different when you are overwriting files or deleting objects.

`New Objects(PUTS)`
- when you put data or write new data to S3 as a new object, it's going to be read after write consistency.
- What that means is as soon as you upload it, you can immediately read the data and it's going to be consistent.

`Overwrite Objects(PUTS) / Delete Objects(DELETES)`
- when it comes to overwriting and deleting objects, it's going to take time for s3 to replicated to all those other AZs. (it only takes like a second or two to update)

- so if you were to immediately read the data, s3 may return to you an old copy.

`AZ`
- Availability Zone
- the logical building block that makes up an AWS Region.
- the isolated locations within data center regions from which public cloud services originate and operate.

### CRR (Cross Region Replication)

- it provides higher durability in the case of disaster
- when you turn it on, we are going to specify a destination bucket in another region.
- and it's going to automatically replicate those objects from the region source.
- it replicate to a bucket in another AWS account which is setting on another region.
- for it, you need to have versioning turned on in both the source and destination buckets.


### Versioning
- what versioning does is it allows you to version your objects.

- it help you to prevent data lose
- and just keeping track of versions.
- if you put a new file which has the exact same key, it's going to create a new version of it. and it's goint to it a new version ID
- the idea is if you access this object, it's always goint to pull the one from the top.
- and if you were to delete that object,
now it's going to access the previous one.
- SO it's a really good way of protecting your 
data.

- if you do turn on S3 versioning, you cannot disable it after the fact.
which means once it's turned on, you cannot remove versioning from existing file.
- all you can do is suspend versioning.

### Lifecycle Management

- what it does is it automates the process of moving objects to different storage classes or deleting them all together.
- it can be used together with versioning
- it can be applied to both current and previous versions


### Transfer Acceleration
- it provides you fast and secure transfer of files over long distances between your end users and S3 bucket.


### Presigned Urls
- it generate a url which authenticate you temporary access to an object to either upload or download object data.
- it is commonly used to provide access to private objects.
- You can use AWS CLI / AWS SDK to generate it.
** CLI : Commend Line Interface 
** SDK : Software Development Kit


### MFA Delete (Multi Factor Authentication)
- it makes you require an MFA code in order to delete object.
- there's some limitations (caveats) around how you can use it or you can't use MFA delete.
    - You must use AWS CLI in order to turn on MFA
    - You have to make sure version is turned on your bucket
    - Only the bucket owner logged in as the root user can delete objects from the bucket.
- This is going to be a really good way to ensure that files do not get deleted by act.
