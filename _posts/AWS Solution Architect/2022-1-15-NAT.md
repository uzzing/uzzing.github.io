## NAT (Network Address Translation)

- local network with its own IP address space 

- Q. why do we want to this?
    : A. two reasons for this.
    - If you have a private networking need to help gain outbound access to the internet, you need to use a NAT gateway to rempat the Private IPs.
    - If you have two networks which have  conflicting network addresses, maybe they actaully have the same, you can use a NAT to make the addresses more agreeable for communication

## NAT instance VS NAT gateway

- NAT have two options
    - NAT instances
    - NAT gateway

### NAT instances
- you have to configure that instance, it's just regular EC2 instance to do that remapping.
- the community came up with a bunch of NAT instances.
- in order for NAT instances to work, they have to be <b>in a public subnet</b>, because it has to be able to reach the internet
    - if it's in a private subnet, there's no way to get to the internet.

### NAT gateways
- <b>`manage service`</b>
- you're not gonna have access to it, Eva 100% manange it for you.
- but it's not just gonna launch one, <b>it's gonna have a redundant instance for you</b>, because when you launch your own NAT instances, if whatever reason it gets taken down, then you'd have to run more than one.
what you have to do is to do all this work to make sure that these instances are going to scale based on your traffic or have the durability that you need.
    - NAT gateways will take care this for you.

- you would lauch it <b>in a public subnet</b>

- <b>you have to launch a NAT gateway per AZ</b>, but you do get redundancy for your instances.
    - NAT gateway doesn't do launch them automatically across other AZs for you.

- Generally, you want to use NAT gateways when possible, because it's the new way of doing it.
but you could still use the legacy way of doing it. (???)

## Summary

Actaully, it's not that important on AWS SAA, is on sysops.
