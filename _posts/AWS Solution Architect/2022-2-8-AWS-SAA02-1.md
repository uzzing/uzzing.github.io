## CloudWatch alarm
- automated recovery of EC2 instance
- automatically stop / terminate / reboot / recover your EC2 instances.
    - stop or terminate actions
        : help you save money when you need longer an instance to be running.
    - reboot and recover actions
         : automatically reboot those instance or recover them onto new hardware if <b>a system impairment occurs like hardware failure.</b>

## CloudWatch VS CloudWatch Agent
- CloudWatch
    : tracks CPU, Network, Disk usage
- CloudWatch Agent 
    : tracks Memory, disk swap, disk space utilization

## CloudTrail
- monitor `API calls` and actions
- governance, compliance, operational auditing, risk auditing logs calls between AWS services.
- turn on by default when you create your account
- but If you need more than 90 days, you need to create additional trail.
- CloudTrail can be set to deliver events to a CloudWatch log
- Trails are output to S3
    - don't have GUI like event history
- To analyze a Trail, need Athena
- Management Events VS Data Events
    - Management Events
        - turned on by default
        - Tracks management operations ex) AttachRolePolicy
    - Data Events
        - turned off by defual
        - Tracks specific operations for specific AWS services ex) GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject..

## Elastic Beanstalk
- an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services
    - developed with Java, `. NET`, PHP, Node. js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.
- Auto Scaling
- monitoring application
- free. pay only for AWS resources

## RDS
- support also Oracle (DynamoDB does not support Oracle)
- always comfirms to the ACID system (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability)

## Aurora
- not serverless



## FSx for Windows File Server
- using Active Directory
- files need to be shared internally
    - have access to files via Microsoft Windows platform

- Keep the expense to a minimum : cost = 0
- Request Pays on a S3 bucket 
    : making data available for third parties (the broader community)

## VPC endpoint
- within the same region

## Lambda resource policy

## Kinesis Data Stream 
- real-time

- EBS is not a target of Firehose (S3 is)
- Kinesis Data Stream + Firehose + S3
- Lambda is not efficient for huge real-time data

## DynamoDB
- a fully managed, multi-Region, multi-active DB that delivers reliable performance at any scale
- scalable, available, 

## DynamaDB Streams
- provide audit logging and monitoring using CloudTrail (Database auditing)

## Redshift
- not DB

- refactoring & replatforming 
    - not minimize modifications

## Security groups VS Network ACL
- security group
    - stateful : only inbound rule is okay
    - for instance
    - can't deny (all is denid by default)
- Network ACL
    - stateless : need both inbound and outbound rule
    - for VPC subnet
    - can deny
