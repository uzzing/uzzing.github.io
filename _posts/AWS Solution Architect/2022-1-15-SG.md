## SG (Security Groups)

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-15 at 11 42 37 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149606247-645fd240-e3b9-43d4-8fae-75a6884f7892.png">

- they protect our EC2 instances by acting as <b>a virtual firewall</b> controlling the inbound and outbound traffic.

- you would <b>attach a security groups to an EC2 instance</b>
- we can set the rules with <b>a particular protocol and a port range, who are allowed to have access.</b>

- in this case, I want to be able to SSH into EC2 instance, which uses the TCP protocol. and <b>the standard port for SSH</b> is 22. And I'm going to <b>allow only my IP</b>, so anytime you see forword /32 that always means my IP.
that's all you have to do to add inbound and outbound rules.


- there are different EC2 instances, they're all in different subnets.
- Security groups do not care about subnets, you just assign EC2 instance to a security group.

### Use cases

- 3 scenarios
    - the configuration is different
    - the idea
        - we have a web application running on a EC2 instance
        - it is connecting to an RDS db to get its information running in a private subnet.

1. 1st case
- we have an inbound rule on the sg-db saying allowing for anything from 5432, which is the Postgre's port number for this specific IP address.
- it allows us EC2 instance to connect with RDS db. 
- the takeaway
    : you can specify the source to be an IP range or a specific IP


2. 2nd case
- the only difference with 1st case is, instead of providing an IP address as a source, we can provide another SG.
- anything within SG is allowed to gain access for inbound traffic on 5432


3. 3rd case
- we have inbound traffic on port 80, inbound traffic on port 22 for the sg-public group.
- we have the EC2 instance and the RDS db within its own security group.
- the EC2 instance is allowed to talk to that RDS db, and that EC2 instance is not exposing the RDS db.
, because it's in a private subnet, that doesn't have a public IP address.
- the takeaway
    : this EC2 instance is able to get traffic from the internet and it's also able to accept someone from like an SSH access.

- you can nest multiple SG onto one EC2 instance

## Limits

- if you want to beyond 2500 SG, you need to make a service limit increase request to Eva support.

- Q. how many SG can you have on an instance?
    : A. it's depending on how many ENIs are actually attached to that SG.
    - if you have 2 ENI that it's attached to a SG, by default you'll have 10.
        - if you have the upper limit, you have 32 SG on a single instance.

## Words
- the big takeaway here is~ : the key point here is~
- keep that stuff
- upper limit : 상한선
