## VPC 
- `Virtual Private Cloud`
- it allows you to provide <b>a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud</b> where you can launch <b>AWS resources in a virtual network that you define</b>.

## Core Components

## Key features
- you can set its tenancy to default or dedicated
    - tenancy
    : how EC2 instances are distributed across physical hardware and affects pricing
    -  default 
    : Multiple AWS accounts may share the same physical hardware. 
    - dedicated
    : Your instance runs on single-tenant hardware.

- Region Specific
    - they do not span regions
- 5 VPC per region
- Every region comes with a default VPC
- 200 subnets per VPC
- The address of the VPC : IPv4 Cidr Block (+IPv6 Cidr Block)
- Cost nothing (it doesn't cost you anything)
    - VPC's / Route Tables / Nacls / Internet Gateways / Security Groups and Subnets / VPC Peering
- Something cost money
    - NAT Gateway / VPC Endpoints / VPN Gateway / Customer Gateway
- DNS hostnames
    - they are disabled by default.
    - should your instance have domain name addresses
    - when you do create a VPC, it doesn't have DNS host names turned on by default
    - so there's Public DNS.

## Default VPC

- DHCP
    : <b>`Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol`</b>
    <b>a client/server protocol</b> that <b>automatically</b> provides an Internet Protocol <b>(IP) host with its IP address</b> and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.

---

## Default Everywhere IP

- giving access from anywhere or the internet

## VPC Peering

- which allows you to <b>connect one VPC to another over direct network route using private IP addresses.</b>
<br>

- the idea
    - we have a VPC A, a VPC B
    - and we want to treat it so like they behave like they're on the same network.
    - that's what VPC peering connection allows us to do
<br>

- it's very simple to create a peering connection
    - just give it a name 
        - <b>requester</b> which could be a VPC A
        - <b>acceptor</b> which could be a VPC B
- allow VPCs to talk to each other even they're in different regions

### Limitations around the configuration

- when you are peering, you're using `star configuaration`
    - `1 central VPC` and you might have `4 other VPCs around it`
    - for each VPC, it have to have a peering connection.
- There's <b>`No Transitive Peering`</b>
    - if VPC C wants to talk to VPC B, hte traffic is not going to flow through a
    - you actually would have to create another direct connection from C to B
    - the idea
    : it's only to the nearest neighbor, where that communication is going to happen. 
- You <b>`can't have Overlapping CIDR Blocks`</b>
    - so it had the same CIDR block, this was 172 31
    - we're gonna have a conflict
    - we're not gonna be able to talk to each other
    - it's the VPC peering in a `nutshell`

## Route Tables

- we can see routes, which has the internet gateway attached that allows access to the internet.

## IGW (Internet Gateway)

- It allows your VPC <b>access to the internet</b>

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-14 at 1 40 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149452625-33f89d72-7c1e-43dc-8fa8-f09d4a876730.png">

- we need to create a new route in our route table for the IGW
- igw-id identifies that resource
- then we're goint to give it 0.0 point zero as the destination

- NAT : Network Address Translation

## Bastion (= Jumpbox)

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-14 at 1 50 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149454827-b6c5de20-7087-420c-b51e-9529d06b17a8.png">


- `SSH` (Secure Shell)
: <b>a network protocol that gives</b> users, particularly system administrators, <b>a secure way</b> to access a computer <b>over an unsecured network.</b>
<br>

- `RCP` (Remote copy)
: a tool for copying files to/from remote computers
<br>
- let's say you wanted to SSH into that EC2 Instance (it's in a private subnet), it doesn't have a public IP address.
- So what you need is you need <b>an intermediate EC2 Instance</b> that you're going to SSH into, which is <b>Bastion</b>
- And then, you're going to <b>jump from that box to this one</b>
    - that's why bastions are also known as jumpboxes

<br>

- EC2 instance for the bastion is hardened
    - so it should be <b>very secure</b>
        - because it's going to be your <b>point of entry</b> into your private EC2 instance.
<br>

- some people might ask 
can't we a NAT instance(like NAT gateways) obviously turn into bastions?

you can configure NATs
and also from a security perspective, you'd never ever want to do that, you always wanna have <b>a different EC2 instance as your Bastion.</b>

There is a service called `Systems manager's session manager`.
`It replaces the need for bastions`, so you don't have to launch your own EC2 instance.
Generally, that's recommended in AWS.

But as you know, Bastions are being commonly used throughout a lot of companies because <b>it needs to meet 
whatever their requirements are.</b> and they're just comfortable with them.

## Direct Connect

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-14 at 2 07 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83699657/149455703-59e78b69-b3fd-456e-9e4b-948903d95911.png">

- depending on what configuration you get
    - if it's <b>in the lower bandwidth</b>, you are looking between 50 megabytes to 500 megabytes.
    - or <b>in the higher bandwidth</b> is 1 gigabytes to 10 gigabytes
<br>

- so the transfer rate to your on-premise environment, the network to AWS, is it <b>considerably fast.</b>

- this can be really important if you are an enterprise and you want to keep the same level of performance that you're used to.

- with direct connect, it helps <b>reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput</b>

- it provides a more consistent network experience than a typical internet based connection

---

### Words

- full-name known as short-name
    - (= short-name stands for full-name)
- it's pretty easy to going forward
- in addition to
- come with
- imply 
- I have a representation of how it works, so the idea is ~
- intend for (=mean)
- be hardened : 굳은
- premise environment
- considerably (= significantly)
- typical (= representative)
- bandwidth throughput : 대역폭 처리량
